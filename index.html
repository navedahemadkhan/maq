              <strong>Inefficiencies of Traditional WAN
</strong>In recent years, businesses are embracing digital transformation more rapidly than ever expected. Remote working and online meetings are now standards. Many applications are moved to the public cloud and many services are now available over the Internet. Companies want to reduce costs and manage their infrastructure more effectively. However, the traditional wide-area network (WAN) was designed to connect users at remote sites to applications hosted in the company's data center. Dedicated leased lines and MPLS circuits were used to provide secure and reliable connectivity to the DC. Although some applications are now in public clouds and the Internet, the traffic from the remote sites must come to the DC first and then be routed to the Public Cloud and back.
           This WAN design no longer works well in a digital world where applications are out of the data center, and the users consuming those applications are using a diverse set of mobile devices. As businesses are rapidly adopting Software-as-a-service (SaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) models, it is pretty common to have ERP applications hosted in AWS, office applications such as Office 365 being used over the Internet, company-specific apps hosted in the HQ data center, and 3rd party applications hosted in another datacenter. In this scenario, the traditional WAN connectivity between the branches and the DC is not the most effective way to connect to all applications and creates the following inefficiencies: </div>

              What is SD-WAN?

              <strong>Traditional WAN</strong>was designed to route traffic from remote sites to the company's data centers using private MPLS circuits. However, the business trends have moved the applications out of the data center and into the public clouds such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Nowadays, moving the users' traffic from branches to the enterprise DC and then out to the cloud or the Internet and back is inefficient, expensive, and not scalable. Also, the rapid digital transformation of enterprises creates new requirements for security, cloud and Internet connectivity, WAN management, and application performance.

              <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
